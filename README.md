# dhcp

## General

This is a DHCP server I'm developing to play pranks on my brother. My wireless router doesn't allow me to set the DNS server via DHCP, so rather than standing up a DHCP server outside my home network, I'm going to just make my own DHCP server. Why the heck not.

## Requirements

* Java SDK 1.7 or above
* Maven 3.something

## Installation

There's really nothing to install at the moment.
